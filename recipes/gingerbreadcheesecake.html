        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Cheesecake:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>aluminum foil</li>
            <li>2 cups gingerbread cookie crumbs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 cup dark brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/3 cup unsulphured molasses</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground ginger</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>3 eggs, room temperature</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cinnamon Whipped Cream:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1/4 cup confectioners' sugar, or to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch springform pan. Wrap the outside of the springform pan 3 to 4 times with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Mix cookie crumbs and melted butter together until mixture resembles wet sand. Press into the prepared springform pan until bottom is evenly covered.</li>
            <li>Combine cream cheese and brown sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth. Add molasses, lemon juice, vanilla extract, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, allspice, and salt; mix until well combined. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating briefly after each addition until just combined. Pour batter over the crust in the pan. Tap the pan on the counter several times to remove any air bubbles.</li>
            <li>Place the springform pan into a larger baking pan, and fill the baking pan with 1 inch hot water, making sure no water gets into the cheesecake batter.</li>
            <li>Bake in the water bath in the preheated oven until the edges of the cheesecake are set and the middle jiggles slightly, about 1 hour. Turn off the oven without removing the cheesecake, leaving it inside until cooled, 1 to 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and water bath. Run the tip of a table knife around the edges of the springform pan before removing to a serving platter. Refrigerate until completely chilled, at least 4 hours.</li>
            <li>Combine whipping cream, powdered sugar, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and salt for the cinnamon whipped cream in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form; do not overmix.</li>
            <li>Top cheesecake with whipped cream just before serving.</li>
        </ol>
