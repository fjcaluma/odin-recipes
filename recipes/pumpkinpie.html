        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (9 inch) unbaked deep-dish pie crust</li>
            <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can Libby's 100% Pure Pumpkin</li>
            <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can Nestle Carnation Evaporated Milk</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Combine sugar, cinnamon, salt, ginger, and cloves in small bowl.</li>
            <li>Beat eggs lightly in large bowl.</li>
            <li>Stir in pumpkin and sugar-spice mixture.</li>
            <li>Gradually stir in evaporated milk. Pour into pie shell.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue to bake until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 more minutes. Remove from the oven and set on a wire rack to cool to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Serve cooled pie immediately or refrigerate until ready to serve. (Do not freeze as this will cause the crust to separate from the filling.)</li>
        </ol>
